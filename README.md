# Python Tutorial

Welcome to the **Python Tutorial** repository!  
This project is created to help beginners learn Python programming through practical examples and explanations.

## About Me

I have recently started learning Python and decided to document my journey and share my notes, code, and practice problems with others who are interested in learning Python. I believe sharing knowledge makes learning more effective and accessible.

## About This Repository

This repository will contain multiple chapters, each focusing on different fundamental concepts of Python.  
The code and explanations are written with the help of GitHub Copilot.
